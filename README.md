## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.49.2

1. Charles Casper Stockman
2. Diana DeGette
3. Raymond Anthony Doane

The candidates results were:
- Charles Casper Stockman received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 total votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 total votes.

The winner of the election was:
- Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
The election commission has requested me some additional data to complete the audit:

1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.

## Election Audit Summary

Elections happen regularly, but can you imagine doing a manual audit of the results every time?
 
It is well known that tabulate the election results manually can be exhausted and time consuming, even if we were to use excel help, it wonâ€™t be as efficient as we wish to. 

For this analysis I created a more easy and automated way to perform an audit of the results for any further election, by going through a whole dataset obtained from various voting methods and creating a code script that helped me deliver optimate results. The script will easily help you:
-	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
-	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate and county received.
-	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate and county won. 
-	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
